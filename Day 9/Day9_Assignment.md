Create a webpage with a form that contains a dropdown list and a text box. Write an onchange event handler for the dropdown list that will change the background color of the text box based on the selected value of the dropdown list.

Develop a simple JavaScript program that uses the onkeypress event to detect when the user types a specific key, such as the "Enter" key, and triggers an action, such as submitting a form or displaying a message.

Create an image gallery that uses the onmouseenter and onmouseleave events to display a caption when the user hovers over an image, and hide the caption when the user moves the mouse away from the image.
