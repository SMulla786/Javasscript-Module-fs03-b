Creating and Filtering DOM Elements
1. Create a basic HTML document with a header, a main section, and a footer.


2. In the main section, create a form with two text inputs for name and gender, and a button to submit the form.


3. When the form is submitted, create a new DOM element to display the submitted data. The element should contain the name and gender values, and a delete button. Append this element to the main section.


4. Add a click event listener to the delete button that removes the corresponding element from the main section.


5. Implement a filtering feature that allows users to filter the displayed elements based on gender value. Add two radio buttons, one for male and one for female. When a radio button is selected, hide all the elements with a gender value that does not match the selected value.
