# Assignment 
1. Create a JavaScript program that defines an object called "person" with the following properties:
- name (string)
- age (number)
- email (string)
- hobbies (array)
- Use console.log() to display the entire object in the console.
2. Next, use the dot notation to add a new property called "location" and set it to your own location.
- Then, use the square bracket notation to update the value of the "email" property to your own email address.
3. Next, create a nested object called "family" with the following properties:
- mother (object with name and age properties)
- father (object with name and age properties)
- siblings (array of objects with name and age properties)
- Use console.log() to display the entire object, including the nested "family" object.
4. Then, define a function called "greet" that takes one parameter: "name". The function should use console.log() to display a personalised greeting message that includes the input name.
5. Next, assign the "greet" function as a method of the "person" object.
- Then, create a shallow clone of the "person" object and use console.log() to display both the original and cloned objects in the console.
- Next, create a deep clone of the "person" object using the JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods. Use console.log() to display both the original and cloned objects in the console.
6. Finally, use the Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() methods to display the keys, values, and key-value pairs of the "person" object in the console.
