- Create a JavaScript program that defines an array called "shoppingList" and populates it with at least five items you might buy at a grocery store.


- Next, use the forEach() method to loop through the array and use console.log() to display each item in the list.


- Then, use the push() method to add another item to the end of the array.


- Next, use the pop() method to remove the last item from the array.


- Then, use the shift() method to remove the first item from the array.


- Next, use the unshift() method to add a new item to the beginning of the array.


- Then, use the filter() method to create a new array called "shortList" that only includes items with less than six characters in their name.


- Next, use the map() method to create a new array called "capitalList" that includes all the items in the original list, but with the first letter capitalised.


- Then, use the reduce() method to calculate the total number of characters in all the items in the original list.


- Next, use the slice() method to create a new array called "partialList" that includes the first three items in the original list.


- Then, use the splice() method to remove the second and third items from the original list.


- Finally, use the sort() method to sort the remaining items in the original list in alphabetical order. Use console.log() to display the sorted list.
