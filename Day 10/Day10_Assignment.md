## Creating a DOM Element and Appending Child:

Write a JavaScript function that creates a button element with the text "Click Me" and appends it to a div element with the id of "container".
Add an event listener to the button element so that when it is clicked, an alert is displayed with the message "Button clicked!".


## Filtering a List based on Gender:

Create an HTML page with a list of at least 10 people's names and genders.
Write a JavaScript function that reads the selected gender from a set of radio buttons and displays only the names of people with that gender in the list, hiding the others.
Add a "Show All" button that, when clicked, displays all the names in the list again.
