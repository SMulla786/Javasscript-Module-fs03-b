Create a JavaScript program that defines a string variable called "sentence" and assigns it a value of your choice.
Use console.log() to display the length of the string using the "length" property.
Next, use the indexOf() method to find the index of the first occurrence of the letter "e" in the string.
Then, use the slice() method to create a new string variable called "firstWord" that includes the first word in the sentence (i.e., all characters up to the first space).
Next, use the substring() method to create a new string variable called "lastWord" that includes the last word in the sentence (i.e., all characters from the last space to the end of the sentence).
Then, use the includes() method to check if the string contains the word "JavaScript". Use console.log() to display the result.
Next, use the replace() method to replace the word "JavaScript" with "Python" in the original string.
Then, use the split() method to create a new array called "words" that contains each word in the sentence as an individual element.
Next, use the join() method to create a new string variable called "newSentence" that is the same as the original sentence, but with each word capitalised.
Finally, use string templates to create a new string variable called "message" that includes the original sentence, the index of the first occurrence of the letter "e", the length of the sentence, and the last word in the sentence. Use console.log() to display the final message.
