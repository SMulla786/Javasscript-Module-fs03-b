Create a JavaScript program that does the following:
1. Create a variable called "num" and assign it a value of your choice.


2. Use the Math.sqrt() method to calculate the square root of "num". Use console.log() to display the result.


3. Use the Math.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Multiply the result by 10 and round it to the nearest whole number using the Math.round() method. Use console.log() to display the result.


4. Use the Date() constructor to create a new date object called "today". Use console.log() to display the current date and time.


5. Use getter functions to extract the following information from the "today" object and display it in the console:
Year
Month (in numeric format)
Day of the month
Day of the week (in numeric format)


6. Use setter functions to set the following values in the "today" object:
- Year to 2022
- Month to December
- Day of the month to 31


7. Use getter functions to extract the updated values from the "today" object and display them in the console.


8. Use the Date() constructor to create a new date object called "birthday". Set the year, month, and day of the month to your own birthday.


9. Use the getTime() method to extract the number of milliseconds between the "birthday" object and the "today" object. Use console.log() to display the result.


10. Use the getTime() method to extract the number of days between the "birthday" object and the "today" object. Use console.log() to display the result.
