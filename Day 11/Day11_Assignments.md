# Event Assignments

- Create a dynamic form with multiple input fields and add event listeners for the "change" event on each input field. Use event propagation to display a message indicating which input field was changed.

- Build a custom tooltip using event listeners for the "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" events on a specific element. The tooltip should display information about the element when the user hovers over it.

- Implement event delegation by adding event listeners for the "click" event to a parent element and dynamically creating child elements with their own "click" event listeners.

- Create a drag-and-drop interface using event listeners for the "mousedown", "mousemove", and "mouseup" events on draggable elements. Use event propagation to handle dragging events on nested elements.

- Implement a custom event emitter that allows you to create and emit custom events in your application. Include methods for adding and removing event listeners, as well as propagating events up or down the DOM tree.

- Build a custom menu system using event listeners for the "mouseover" and "mouseout" events on a parent element. The menu should dynamically display submenus when the user hovers over specific menu items.
