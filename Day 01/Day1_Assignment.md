- Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable called "message" and assigns it the value "Hello, world!". Use console.log() to display the message in the console. 
- Then, modify the program to define another variable called "name" and assign it your own name. Use console.log() to display a personalised message that includes both the "message" variable and the "name" variable.
