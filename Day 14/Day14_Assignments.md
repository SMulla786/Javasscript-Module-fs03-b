- Write a function that takes a callback function as an argument and returns a Promise. The Promise should resolve with the result of the callback function.
- Write a function that takes an array of URLs as an argument and uses callbacks to make an HTTP GET request to each URL. The function should return a Promise that resolves with an array of the responses.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when all the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value should be an array of the resolved values of the input Promises.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when the first input Promise has resolved. The resolved value should be the resolved value of the first input Promise.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when all the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value should be an object with the resolved value of each input Promise mapped to its index in the input array.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when all the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value should be an array of the resolved values of the input Promises in the order they were provided.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when all the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value should be the sum of the resolved values of the input Promises.

- Write a function that takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves when all the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value should be the maximum of the resolved values of the input Promises.


#### These assignments will help you develop a deeper understanding of Callbacks, Promise, and handling Promise objects in JavaScript.
